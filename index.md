Title: I am Joren Dryden
---

I am a dual-degree student at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. I am pursuing a B.Sc in computer science and a B.A in philosophy. My interests mainly include: game development, software engineering, existentialism/nihilism, and philosophy of mind. In my spare time I enjoy music production in FLStudio, making games in Godot, playing video games, and exploring Saskatoon.
