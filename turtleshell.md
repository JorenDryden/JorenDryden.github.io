    <p>
      TurtleShell is a locally hosted encryption manager designed to securely store documents,
      passwords, and other sensitive data. The project emphasized industry standard cryptographic
      practices alongside a clean, intuitive, and visually polished user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      The application was developed primarily in Java, using Java’s cryptography libraries for secure
      data handling and JavaFX for the graphical user interface. The core goal was to balance strong
      security guarantees with usability, making the tool robust while remaining accessible to non technical users.
